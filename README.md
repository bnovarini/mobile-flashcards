# Mobile Flashcards

This project is part of my Udacity React Native course.

It creates a simple frontend in React Native to create flashcards for your study subjects.

- Users can:
  - Create a new deck of flashcards, which can be helpful when categorizing your subjects to study
  - View all their created decks
  - Add cards to their decks
  - Start quizzes on their deck and track how many answers they are getting right
  - If you don't remember the answer to a question, you can always flip the flashcard to find out

## Getting started

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
- start the development server with `yarn start`

## Tested platforms and devices

This project layout and functionality has been tested on iOS.

Although its functionality works for Android, keyboard input seems to hide some components behind the Android top tab header.
